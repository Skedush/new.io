Normal workday. I went to bed early yesterday, so I woke up feeling much better today. The weather is also nice.

Today is a working day before the Spring Festival holiday. Not sure if it's due to lack of sleep or an uncomfortable posture, but my cervical spine started hurting, causing a headache all day. In the evening, I went home, freshened up early, watched some videos, and went to bed.

Woke up a little after 8 AM. Played with my phone for a while, got up and had congee, went downstairs to pick up a parcel. My Nike black and white panda shoes arrived, replicas from Putian, but bought one size too large. In the afternoon, went to an internet cafe to play 'League of Legends' in the URF mode. Played until around 7 PM, got a headache, had dinner, and went home to rest.

Normal work day. In the morning, exercised arms and shoulder muscles after getting up. After work, went to an internet cafe to play 'League of Legends' with the URF mode. This version of URF isn't enjoyable; it's all tanks.
