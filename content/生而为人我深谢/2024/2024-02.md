#Thursday  #Zhongguancun-Science-Park  #Light-Rain 
Normal workday. Today is February 29th, a leap year, which is considered a bit special, but time continues as usual, so nothing particularly significant. Played League of Legends with friends in the evening.

Normal work day, went to the internet cafe to play games in the evening. Today, the network administrator returned to being the old man as before, without any female network administrator. Played normally until around 11:00 pm and then went home to rest.

Yesterday night I didn't sleep well, I stayed awake all night, and now I can't tell if I'm awake or asleep. I took leave around 6 o'clock in the morning, rested for the entire morning, and only came to work in the afternoon. I don't know if it's because I didn't rest well or if I sat for too long, but my back is very uncomfortable. I need to exercise and rest when I go back tonight. In the evening, I went to the internet cafe again for about two hours before returning home around 8:30 pm to exercise. I also chatted with a new female friend for a while during this time, then rested.

  I spent the whole day playing League of Legends with friends at the internet cafe, and during a conversation with the new network administrator, I found out that the previous network administrator, the girl I liked, had already quit. Feeling disappointed.

Today, I spent the whole day playing League of Legends with friends at the internet cafe, but she wasn't there.

Today, I went to work as usual. After work, I went to the internet cafe with a friend to play League of Legends. She was still working there with another network administrator. I bought two bottles of drinks to create a topic, then refunded and repaid them. Later, I found out that today was her last day working here. It was really something I had anticipated.

Today, I went to work as usual. After work, I went to the internet cafe with a friend to play League of Legends. She and another network administrator were working there. I didn't have the opportunity to ask.

Today, I went to work as usual. In the afternoon, I had some lower back pain, so I took a short walk outside and then stood at my desk. In the evening, I went to the internet cafe again. The female network administrator was working again. Before entering, I encountered a woman selling phone cards, but I declined and went inside. However, I still didn't gather the courage to ask for her contact information. She always seems expressionless, making it difficult for me to speak up. She should have finished work around 9 PM. I saw her chatting with another male network administrator, both of them smiling. I returned home around 10:30 PM, did some light exercise, took a shower, and then rested.

#Tuesday #Zhongguancun-Science-Park  #Cloudy 
Today, I went to work as usual. After work, I grabbed some fast food, then went home to change clothes before heading to the internet cafe to play games. As I arrived at the internet cafe, I noticed a woman downstairs who resembled the network administrator, but she was wearing a mask. Without speaking to her, I went straight upstairs. Later, I regretted not talking to her and decided to look for her after starting my computer. However, she was nowhere to be found. I felt a sense of regret. I went back upstairs to play games until around 10:30 PM, then returned home, did some light exercise, and rested.

Normal day at work, donated 40 yuan to the Z-library project. In the evening, played League of Legends with friends. Originally wanted to ask for the WeChat of the female network administrator, but she wasn't there when I went over. I unexpectedly felt a bit lost, as if I missed someone I cared about. Worried she might have left her job. Later found out from the new network administrator that she was just on duty, indicating she hadn't left. Will definitely ask her when she's back. No issue of pride, just need to be confident. Also, one friend was too frustrating to play games with, so I didn't feel like playing anymore.

Today is the first day back to work this year. There was a 100 yuan red envelope given out as a New Year gift, but there wasn't much work to do. I ended up wasting the day, and in the evening, I played League of Legends with friends.

#Saturday #Home-to-Wenzhou #Cloudy 
Today is the last day of the holiday, and tomorrow we have to go back to work. After breakfast, I packed my bags and left home around 12:20 noon. I took public transportation from my home to Wenzhou. There was some traffic on the highway, which delayed us by about half an hour, but I had anticipated this and bought a later train ticket. We arrived at the train station just in time to board. We reached Wenzhou South Station at 4:00 PM and arrived at the dormitory where I stay around 5:00 PM. After unpacking and resetting the WiFi, I went out to grab a quick meal and surf the internet.

Got up at noon, had lunch, and went to the internet cafe with friends to play games. We also invited a friend who had just returned to Guangzhou a few days ago to join us. In the evening, we continued playing games with our friend from Guangzhou.

#Thursday #Nanjianyan-Scenic-Spot #Rain
Today was supposed to be dinner at my aunt's house. I didn't feel like going, so in the afternoon, I planned to play games, but my friend invited me to Nanjianyan instead. It was raining and a bit cold. The glass bridge cost 60 yuan per person, but I got in for free. The mountain was steep, but I didn't feel tired. When we were walking on the glass bridge, it started raining heavily, and the wind was strong, making it very cold. After coming down from the mountain, we went to my friend's house for dinner. In the evening, after a short stroll, I went home to take a shower. After showering, I went out with my buddy to have supper.

After lunch, I was planning to go to the internet cafe to play games, but my friend invited me out to play, so I didn't go to the internet cafe. In the afternoon, I went to Qianfo Mountain with my friends. I don't know why the mountain didn't seem so steep, but I felt really tired after playing. Maybe I have no affinity with Buddha. In the evening, my relatives came to my house for dinner. After dinner, they started playing mahjong again, while I watched for a while and then went out with friends to set off fireworks. Later, we went to the night market for barbecue. They finished playing mahjong and joined us for barbecue before heading home.

#Tuesday  #Home #Sunny 
Today my good buddies planned a gathering. We had lunch at my place, then I went to meet them. They booked a room at the Overseas Chinese Hotel and played mahjong in the afternoon. In the evening, two friends from Ningbo also joined us. We went to the home of a friend in Suichang for dinner, bringing some New Year goods with us. They continued playing mahjong in the evening. Another friend rushed back from Lishui just to see the friends from Ningbo.

#Monday #Home #Sunny 
In the morning, I woke up early and exercised for half an hour. Then I had breakfast, watched some anime, took a shower, and did the laundry. I went to my aunt's house for lunch. After lunch, my friend（Can） and his spouse were going to Wenzhou to visit relatives, so I saw them off and then went to see another friend（XiaoHao）. We watched some anime at his place, went out for a walk, enjoyed the sun for a while, and then headed home. In the evening, I'm going to my uncle's house for dinner.After dinner, I went to the internet cafe with my friend to play the Unlimited Firepower mode of League of Legends.

#Sunday  #Home #Sunny 
Today, I slept until noon. After lunch, my brother and I went to visit our uncle's house to pay our New Year's respects, bringing along some gifts. In the afternoon, my cousin and his wife came to our house to celebrate the New Year. We spent some time together before heading to my aunt's house for dinner in the evening. Interestingly, while they had planned visits to other relatives' houses, they skipped ours. Perhaps they felt pressed for time, but it doesn't matter to me. I'm not interested in fostering those relationships.

In the evening, we went to the outskirts to buy fireworks and then went to the riverside across from my house to set them off. We hadn't been playing for long when a friend called, saying he had drunk too much and couldn't drive, so I had to drive him to a hotel. Afterward, I went to an internet cafe to have some supper before heading home.

Today, I had plans to go mountain climbing with some friends at 8:30 AM, but I overslept. I woke up at 9:00 AM and left for the mountain at 9:30. Since it was the first day of the Lunar New Year, there were many people climbing the mountain and paying their respects. We didn't make it to the summit and instead descended via the mountain road on the west side around 11:30 AM. We went back home for lunch.

In the afternoon, I rested for a while and then went to watch a movie from 2:30 PM to 4:30 PM. We watched 'Pegasus' directed by Han Han, but I wasn't feeling well, possibly due to the windy conditions on the mountain in the morning, which gave me a headache. I felt quite drowsy during the movie and couldn't focus. The movie itself was average, lacking any standout elements. After the movie, I went home and rested.

In the evening, after dinner and a shower, my headache eased up. I went out with two friends to watch fireworks and then played cards at the mall. We finished around 9:00 PM and I went back home to chat with my parents for a few hours. I went to bed at 11:00 PM.

I took the high-speed train at 10:14 in the morning. I woke up at 8:00, freshened up, and had breakfast. Around 9:00, I left to catch the train. I arrived in Lishui around 10:50. A friend came to pick me up to go home together. She had to go back to the office for some work, so we just grabbed a quick lunch before heading home. In the afternoon, my childhood friend came over to my place, and we chatted for a while before having dinner. In the evening, after everyone finished dinner, we planned to go out and set off fireworks, but we couldn't find any for sale. Instead, we went to another friend's house to play cards. I returned home around 22:00, took a shower, and went to bed.

Today, sensing that it might rain, I took the bus to work. I heard some good news that we were getting off work early in the afternoon. I wasted the morning away, and as soon as I finished lunch, I headed home. After changing my shoes, I went to the internet cafe with the intention of asking for the WeChat of the administrator. However, seeing how reserved they seemed, I felt hesitant to ask. I thought of finding another opportunity to avoid asking too abruptly. But not speaking up is also because of my own personality—I'm quite reserved and shy. I assumed she would get off work around 9:00 PM, planning to leave with her. However, I realized I estimated it wrong; it might have been around 9:30 PM or 10:00 PM. I waited downstairs for a long time but didn't see her come out. Eventually, I went back home, packed my things, and rested.

Normal work day, researching compatibility issues with the unified platform. Managed to move the static code of a third-party frontend project into our platform's packaged code using the 'mv' command in the shell, making it accessible via URL. After work, went to the internet, contemplated asking for the WeChat of a female administrator at the internet cafe, but didn't act on it.

Today is a working day before the Spring Festival holiday. Not sure if it's due to lack of sleep or an uncomfortable posture, but my cervical spine started hurting, causing a headache all day. In the evening, I went home, freshened up early, watched some videos, and went to bed.

Woke up a little after 8 AM. Played with my phone for a while, got up and had congee, went downstairs to pick up a parcel. My Nike black and white panda shoes arrived, replicas from Putian, but bought one size too large. In the afternoon, went to an internet cafe to play 'League of Legends' in the URF mode. Played until around 7 PM, got a headache, had dinner, and went home to rest.
