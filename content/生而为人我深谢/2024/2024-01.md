I felt very hot while sleeping last night because the blanket my mom laid out for me was too thick. After waking up, I had dumplings and watched TV dramas and anime. Around 11:00 AM, I went to my aunt's house for a meal, but the main couple of the wedding hadn't arrived yet. They said they would arrive in about an hour. I planned to wash my hair and withdraw some cash, but I found out that the hair salon where I had previously prepaid was closed. Unable to withdraw the money, I deliberated whether to give the gift money. I called a friend about this and decided to head back home first. After a simple meal, I helped them move some things, then went to withdraw money and wandered the streets for a while before returning home. For dinner, I attended a banquet at a hotel. Before leaving, my mom had a bathroom incident where the toilet got clogged. We tried to fix it but couldn't, so I went to the hotel with my uncle by taxi. The event had a simple opening and the banquet had minimal dishes. I gave the gift money even though it wasn't necessary, but I did it for the sake of our friendship. After leaving, I briefly met with a potential match at a designated location, but she had friends with her, making it difficult to have a proper conversation.

I slacked off at work and took the afternoon off due to needing to attend a relative's wedding over the weekend. Before going home, I changed to a different room in an available rental space. After quickly moving my things, I rushed to catch transportation. The weather was good, but it was hot inside the vehicle, causing me to sweat. I departed at 14:30 and arrived in my hometown city around 18:30. A friend came to pick me up and treated me to a meal. After eating, we went to the mall for a while, then I said goodbye and returned to my place.

#Thursday #Zhongguancun-Science-Park  #Sunny 
Worked normally today; most of yesterday's tasks were completed, so there wasn't much to do. In the evening, after work, a colleague treated us to lamb chops. I apologized for causing inconvenience to my colleagues last Thursday due to getting drunk. After the evening ended, I went to play League of Legends again.

Worked normally today, very diligently. I worked on fixing bugs for the project undergoing testing. In the evening, a friend who was on a business trip to Wenzhou invited me for dinner, and we went to have barbecue. After returning home, I went online again.

Because I couldn't sleep last night, I got up around 6 AM to pack my luggage to move back to my previous place. I was supposed to work today but took a sick day. Then, the landlord suggested trying the north-facing room, saying it's quieter there. I had already arranged moving services but ended up canceling them. Moved to the north-facing room to give it a try. Cleaned up a bit, only made the bed, then went out to surf the internet. Because I hadn't rested all night, my heart felt very uncomfortable. I tried to sleep in the evening but couldn't fall asleep. After lying down for 2 hours, I got up to take a shower and eat. I finally fell asleep around midnight; this place is indeed much quieter.

I woke up today and started by watching anime. Then, I packed my luggage and after having lunch, I booked a moving service through Meituan. I continued organizing my things and set off at 2 o'clock. The traffic was heavy; it took me 30 minutes to cover a 2-kilometer distance. The movers carried my belongings to the 5th floor, and the service cost a total of 165 RMB. There was no hot water in the room, so I went back to my previous rental place to freshen up. After turning on the water heater, I went to an internet caf√© to play games. When the water was heated, I returned to take a shower and then carried the last bit of my belongings to the new place. I spent the whole night cleaning. When I went to bed, I noticed the loud train noises outside the window. I hadn't paid attention to this during the house viewing. In the quiet night, the noise was exceptionally loud, as if a train was passing right by my bed. Perhaps it's due to the new place or maybe I was too warm with too many clothes on while sleeping, but I couldn't fall asleep all night.
