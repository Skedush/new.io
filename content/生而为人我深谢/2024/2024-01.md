Worked normally today; most of yesterday's tasks were completed, so there wasn't much to do. In the evening, after work, a colleague treated us to lamb chops. I apologized for causing inconvenience to my colleagues last Thursday due to getting drunk.

Worked normally today, very diligently. I worked on fixing bugs for the project undergoing testing. In the evening, a friend who was on a business trip to Wenzhou invited me for dinner, and we went to have barbecue. After returning home, I went online again.

Because I couldn't sleep last night, I got up around 6 AM to pack my luggage to move back to my previous place. I was supposed to work today but took a sick day. Then, the landlord suggested trying the north-facing room, saying it's quieter there. I had already arranged moving services but ended up canceling them. Moved to the north-facing room to give it a try. Cleaned up a bit, only made the bed, then went out to surf the internet. Because I hadn't rested all night, my heart felt very uncomfortable. I tried to sleep in the evening but couldn't fall asleep. After lying down for 2 hours, I got up to take a shower and eat. I finally fell asleep around midnight; this place is indeed much quieter.

I woke up today and started by watching anime. Then, I packed my luggage and after having lunch, I booked a moving service through Meituan. I continued organizing my things and set off at 2 o'clock. The traffic was heavy; it took me 30 minutes to cover a 2-kilometer distance. The movers carried my belongings to the 5th floor, and the service cost a total of 165 RMB. There was no hot water in the room, so I went back to my previous rental place to freshen up. After turning on the water heater, I went to an internet café to play games. When the water was heated, I returned to take a shower and then carried the last bit of my belongings to the new place. I spent the whole night cleaning. When I went to bed, I noticed the loud train noises outside the window. I hadn't paid attention to this during the house viewing. In the quiet night, the noise was exceptionally loud, as if a train was passing right by my bed. Perhaps it's due to the new place or maybe I was too warm with too many clothes on while sleeping, but I couldn't fall asleep all night.
