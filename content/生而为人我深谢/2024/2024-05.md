After finishing lunch, I took a bus to Wenzhou. Upon arrival, I tidied up the room, had dinner, and then went to an internet cafe to play League of Legends. After returning home, my childhood friend called to wish me a happy birthday since tomorrow is my birthday. We chatted until 1 o'clock in the morning, but there wasn't much substance to our conversation. I realized that we seemed to lack common topics of discussion and were only communicating based on our past relationship.

In the afternoon, I stopped by my childhood friend's shop for a while, bought some coffee, and went back home. In the evening, a friend brought me some honey, and I spent 160 yuan to buy 1 kilogram. Later in the evening, I ordered some milk tea.

Yesterday, I caught a cold and didn't sleep well. I stayed at home all day. In the afternoon, feeling very tired and wanting to sleep, I bought some coffee and spent the afternoon watching anime. After dinner, my heart started beating fast. I took a shower and went to bed around 8 PM. I stayed on my phone in bed until midnight before falling asleep.

Today, I woke up at noon and went to an internet cafe with friends to play games. In the evening, I had fish for dinner at home, and then went to my childhood friend's flower shop to have dinner. We chatted with two childhood friends all evening, but the conversation didn't bring up anything new. After returning home and taking a shower, I wore a short-sleeved shirt and shorts, and spent the evening debugging the company's custom form project on the computer. I kept debugging until almost 2 AM before it was completed. Due to wearing too little clothing, I caught a cold. Combined with drinking alcohol in the evening, I felt dizzy.

We talked about his travels for a while. In the evening, after dinner, I had a chat with my mother and then went out with my childhood friend for a late-night snack.
