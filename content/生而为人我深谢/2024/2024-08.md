Today is the Qixi Festival (Chinese Valentine's Day). I originally planned to test the waters with her, but an invisible force held me back, so I didn't follow through. I spent the day exercising in my room, focusing on core and chest muscles. In the evening, I went out for a 40-minute walk. After returning, I watched some videos and went to bed.
今天是七夕情人节，本来想着打算试探一下她。但是被有种无形的力量压制了。没有执行该计划，今天在房间锻炼了一天。练了核心与胸肌，晚上出门散步40多分钟。回来刷视频睡觉。

It was a regular workday, and I had dinner plans in the evening, so I didn't go cycling. As soon as I got to the office, I started fixing a project bug that took almost the entire day. One of my team members has had such a poor attitude lately that it's been affecting my work and mood. After work, I gave him a warning, letting him know this is his last chance; if things don't improve, I'll have the company let him go. In the evening, I had dinner with colleagues.
正常上班，晚上约了聚餐，没有骑车。今天一到公司就有项目的bug在修改，几乎改了一天。由于我手下的一个员工的工作态度太差，最近都影响到我的工作与心情了，所以下班给他提醒了一番，再最后给他一次机会，不行就让公司裁掉了。晚上和同事聚餐。

I had a regular workday, and today there were new tasks. I spent the day setting up the framework and thinking about the design, so I didn't get around to practicing a LeetCode algorithm problem as I had planned. In the evening, I worked out my leg muscles. My protein powder arrived, and it tasted pretty good. Afterward, I went for a 30-minute walk.
Before falling asleep, in that hazy half-asleep state, I dreamt of someone singing a heart-wrenching love song. It sounded like one of those cellphone ringtones you'd hear on TV around the early 2000s. I even tried to remember the lyrics, but after half a minute of dreaming, I woke up and couldn't recall the song at all. I've had similar dreams before where there's a beautiful song with a familiar yet fresh melody, but I can never remember the song's content upon waking. It's like when you hear a new song and can sing along while it's playing, but after listening to a few other songs, you can't remember how to hum it anymore unless you listen to a bit of it again.
正常上班，今天有新的任务。搭框架和思考内容的设计花了一天，本来想着练习一题leetcode的算法题的。也没有执行。晚上回家练习了腿部肌肉。蛋白粉到了，喝了味道还不错。然后出门走路30分钟。在睡着前朦胧的半睡半醒的时间在做梦，听到梦中的人唱着一首撕心裂肺的情歌。像是千禧年电视上会放的那种手机铃声的歌曲。还特地记了歌词，但是又继续做了半分钟的梦吧，醒来想查找这首歌却怎么想都想不起来了。记得以前也做过好几次类似的梦，都是有一首好听的歌，以前好像听过类似的旋律，但是又有新鲜感，像是没听过的歌曲只是有类似的旋律。同样的事是醒来都不能记得梦中歌曲的内容，只是有一点旋律感觉，想哼唱也是不能做到的。就像你现在听了一首新的歌曲，现在跟着可以合唱。在继续听了几首其他歌曲后，就记不得这首歌如何哼唱了，一定要重新听了一点后才能记起一样。

After waking up, I worked out my core. After breakfast and a short rest, I trained my chest and arms. In the evening, I went out for a 10-kilometer bike ride. A friend asked to borrow money again, saying it was for his child's elementary school tuition. We chatted briefly about our recent lives. Later in the evening, I watched some videos and then went for a 20-minute walk.
起床后健身练习核心，吃完饭休息一会又开始健身训练胸肌和手臂。傍晚又出门骑行10公里。兄弟又找我借钱，说是小孩子上小学了，需要交学费。然后简单聊了一会最近的生活吧。晚上看了一会视频又出门散步了20分钟。

After waking up, I spent a long time creating a new Telegram account because my old account had sensitive content. The registration process was unsuccessful for a while. I also set up Windows and Ubuntu Server virtual machines. Eventually, I was able to register successfully by logging in with a U.S. Apple ID and downloading Telegram. In the afternoon, I chatted with her for a while, as we hadn't talked in a long time. Later, I went out for a walk and watched some videos.
起床后创建telegram账号弄了好久。由于原来账号的敏感内容问题，需要创建一个新的账号，一直注册不成功。还装了windows虚拟机和ubuntu server虚拟机。最后是登录了美国的appleId下载的telegram才注册成功。下午和她聊了一会天，好久都没联系了。出门散步刷视频。

Regular workday. I got up at 7:10 AM and did some core exercises. Since we had planned a dinner gathering for the evening, I didn't go biking. However, one friend couldn't make it, so the plans were canceled. At work, I did a LeetCode problem. After work, I walked home, and my takeout arrived just as I got there, so I didn't work out. Before bed, I went for a 30-minute walk.
正常上班，早晨7:10起床练了核心。由于晚上约好聚餐，所以今天没骑车，后来由于一个伙伴不能到，所以又爽约了。上班刷了一提leetcode。又在斟酌昨天的诗，又改了一次。“早昼簪曦晨，朔月散期朋”或者“早昼簪曦晨，明月散期朋”。晚上下班后没有锻炼，走路回家的，到家外卖就到了，所以没有健身了。只是睡前出去散步了30分钟。

Regular workday. I woke up at 7:10 AM and did some core exercises. In the morning, I spent time creating poetry using ChatGPT and the Xinhua Dictionary. I registered the domain zzzxc.com and came up with the phrase "早昼簪星晨" (all containing the "日" radical). I thought the best matching second line would be "朔月散青棚" (all containing the "月" character), as it maintains rhyme, tone, and a similar artistic mood. In the afternoon, I studied some Spring framework concepts and also went for a walk. In the evening, I worked out my back before dinner, watched some videos afterward, and then went for a half-hour walk.
正常上班，早晨7:10起床练了核心。上午在利用chatgpt和新华字典作诗。我注册的域名为zzzxc.com，造了一个句子“早昼簪星晨”。都带“日”部件，得出我认为最适合的下句是“朔月散青棚”都带月字。并且押韵平仄意境都还算可以。下午学了一会spring知识，也有出门出门走路。晚上回家饭前锻炼了背部。饭后刷视频，然后出门散步半小时。
