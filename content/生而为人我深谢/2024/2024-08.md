正常上班，早起为了黑神话与瑞幸的联名周边，点了两杯咖啡，然后还是没有获得，瑞幸活动做不清楚，有周边的产品没及时上架。导致了很多人操作失误，我也是其中一个，被迫花钱喝了两杯咖啡，还没得到周边。下午认真上班了半天。出门散步半小时，晚上回去练了手臂，吃完饭后玩了ps上的游戏再键了一会视频。买了ps plus会员，下载了很多游戏，然后睡觉了。
I had a regular workday today. In the morning, I ordered two coffees early to try to get the ‘Black Myth’ and Luckin Coffee collaboration merchandise, but I didn’t get any. Luckin’s promotion was poorly managed; they didn’t put up the merchandise on time, which led to a lot of people, including me, making mistakes. So I ended up having to pay for two coffees without getting the merchandise. In the afternoon, I focused on work for half the day.I went out for a 30-minute walk, then went back home and did an arm workout. After dinner, I played some games on the PS5 and edited some videos for a while. I also bought a PS Plus membership, downloaded a bunch of games, and then went to bed.

I started the day with a core workout, played some games, and then went out for lunch. In the afternoon, my capture card arrived, so I spent some time setting it up to capture footage on my computer. After playing games for a bit longer, the monitor box arrived, so I went to the office to bring my monitor home. I continued to tweak the capture card but found that 4K 60Hz couldn’t be captured on my MacBook Pro due to Type-C bandwidth limitations. I ordered takeout, worked out my back and shoulders, and then picked up a Wi-Fi shelf I had ordered, installed it, and then had dinner. I realized that if I livestreamed, the audio wouldn’t be recorded, so I spent some time selecting and ordering a headset. Later, feeling really thirsty, I went out to buy two bottles of coconut milk. After drinking them, I showered and went to bed.
起床后练了核心，玩了一会游戏，然后出门吃午饭，下午采集卡到了，调试了一会可以采集到画面到我的电脑上。继续玩了一会游戏后装显示器的箱子到了，到公司搬我的显示器回家。又继续调试了采集卡，4k60hz是无法采集到我的MBP中的，说是typec的带宽不行。点了外卖锻炼了背部与肩部，然后下楼拿了挂wifi的架子，安装好后吃饭。发现要是直播的话音频不能录制的。挑了一会耳麦下单了。然后很渴出门买了两瓶椰奶。喝完洗澡睡觉了

"I started the day with a core workout, then had breakfast and played PS5 games until around 2 PM, after which I did a chest workout and watched some videos. In the evening, I went out for a bike ride. After dinner, I continued playing PS5, and later, I edited and uploaded some of my old fitness videos online."

"I started the day with a core workout and then went to work. After being at the office for about half an hour, I got a call from the delivery service saying that my Sony device had arrived and needed to be signed for. So, I rode back home to sign for the package and then returned to work. I spent the day browsing online stores again and bought a MacBook docking station with an Ethernet port for nearly 400 yuan, using a 3-month installment plan. In the evening, I went home, unboxed the PS5, recorded a video, and set up the PS5. After installing a few games and trying them out for a bit, I took a shower and went to bed."
早起练习了核心，正常上班，刚到公司半小时，快递打电话来了，说我的索尼设备到了，要我签收，我就有骑车回去签收了快递，再回到公司上班。今天也是逛了一天的线上商城。买了macbook的拓展坞，带网口的，花了将近400元，分期3期。晚上回家就开箱ps5，录制了视频，然后做了初始化ps5等工作。然后安装了几个游戏体验了一会。就洗澡睡觉了

"I started the day with a core workout, then went to work, but didn't get much done. I spent most of the day browsing online stores, checking out accessories for the PS5. I bought a 27-inch monitor box so I can take the monitor from my office home, and I also purchased a video capture card for over 500 yuan, with a 12-month installment plan, to use for streaming PS5 gameplay. I looked into some cooling options as well. In the evening, I worked out my legs, watched some videos, and then went to bed."

"Normal workday. I went to bed early last night but woke up before 4 AM and couldn't fall back asleep. I spent the early morning scrolling through my phone and watching videos until dawn.

"I didn't sleep well last night and took the morning off. Despite taking leave, I couldn't fall back asleep after waking up at 8:30. I felt very anxious and conflicted, with personal life, family emotions, and work stress all contributing to my tension. I couldn't relax. I went to work in the afternoon, but I was exhausted. After dinner, I went straight to bed."
昨天一夜没睡好，上午请假了。虽然请假了，8：30醒了后就没有再睡着了。整个人很焦虑和矛盾。个人的生活情感、家庭情感和工作因素等导致精神比较紧张，得不到放松。下午去上班了，很累。晚上回家吃了晚饭直接休息了。

I spent the entire day exercising today. After waking up, I worked on my core, and in the afternoon, I trained my back and arms. I recently bought a PS5, and before bed, I stayed up late researching about it, which led to insomnia. In the middle of the night, unable to sleep, I started reflecting on my life and the potential impact the console might have on it. Realizing it could disrupt my daily routine, I decided to cancel the order since it hadn't shipped yet.
今天运动了一天，起床练了核心，下午练了背部与手臂。前几天买了ps5，晚上睡前在了解ps5的相关知识熬夜导致失眠了，大半夜的睡不着，再思考自己的生活与游戏，觉得该游戏机会影响到自己的正常生活，看还没发货又退货了。

Today is the Qixi Festival (Chinese Valentine's Day). I originally planned to test the waters with her, but an invisible force held me back, so I didn't follow through. I spent the day exercising in my room, focusing on core and chest muscles. In the evening, I went out for a 40-minute walk. After returning, I watched some videos and went to bed.
今天是七夕情人节，本来想着打算试探一下她。但是被有种无形的力量压制了。没有执行该计划，今天在房间锻炼了一天。练了核心与胸肌，晚上出门散步40多分钟。回来刷视频睡觉。

It was a regular workday, and I had dinner plans in the evening, so I didn't go cycling. As soon as I got to the office, I started fixing a project bug that took almost the entire day. One of my team members has had such a poor attitude lately that it's been affecting my work and mood. After work, I gave him a warning, letting him know this is his last chance; if things don't improve, I'll have the company let him go. In the evening, I had dinner with colleagues.
正常上班，晚上约了聚餐，没有骑车。今天一到公司就有项目的bug在修改，几乎改了一天。由于我手下的一个员工的工作态度太差，最近都影响到我的工作与心情了，所以下班给他提醒了一番，再最后给他一次机会，不行就让公司裁掉了。晚上和同事聚餐。

I had a regular workday, and today there were new tasks. I spent the day setting up the framework and thinking about the design, so I didn't get around to practicing a LeetCode algorithm problem as I had planned. In the evening, I worked out my leg muscles. My protein powder arrived, and it tasted pretty good. Afterward, I went for a 30-minute walk.
Before falling asleep, in that hazy half-asleep state, I dreamt of someone singing a heart-wrenching love song. It sounded like one of those cellphone ringtones you'd hear on TV around the early 2000s. I even tried to remember the lyrics, but after half a minute of dreaming, I woke up and couldn't recall the song at all. I've had similar dreams before where there's a beautiful song with a familiar yet fresh melody, but I can never remember the song's content upon waking. It's like when you hear a new song and can sing along while it's playing, but after listening to a few other songs, you can't remember how to hum it anymore unless you listen to a bit of it again.
正常上班，今天有新的任务。搭框架和思考内容的设计花了一天，本来想着练习一题leetcode的算法题的。也没有执行。晚上回家练习了腿部肌肉。蛋白粉到了，喝了味道还不错。然后出门走路30分钟。在睡着前朦胧的半睡半醒的时间在做梦，听到梦中的人唱着一首撕心裂肺的情歌。像是千禧年电视上会放的那种手机铃声的歌曲。还特地记了歌词，但是又继续做了半分钟的梦吧，醒来想查找这首歌却怎么想都想不起来了。记得以前也做过好几次类似的梦，都是有一首好听的歌，以前好像听过类似的旋律，但是又有新鲜感，像是没听过的歌曲只是有类似的旋律。同样的事是醒来都不能记得梦中歌曲的内容，只是有一点旋律感觉，想哼唱也是不能做到的。就像你现在听了一首新的歌曲，现在跟着可以合唱。在继续听了几首其他歌曲后，就记不得这首歌如何哼唱了，一定要重新听了一点后才能记起一样。

After waking up, I worked out my core. After breakfast and a short rest, I trained my chest and arms. In the evening, I went out for a 10-kilometer bike ride. A friend asked to borrow money again, saying it was for his child's elementary school tuition. We chatted briefly about our recent lives. Later in the evening, I watched some videos and then went for a 20-minute walk.

After waking up, I spent a long time creating a new Telegram account because my old account had sensitive content. The registration process was unsuccessful for a while. I also set up Windows and Ubuntu Server virtual machines. Eventually, I was able to register successfully by logging in with a U.S. Apple ID and downloading Telegram. In the afternoon, I chatted with her for a while, as we hadn't talked in a long time. Later, I went out for a walk and watched some videos.
起床后创建telegram账号弄了好久。由于原来账号的敏感内容问题，需要创建一个新的账号，一直注册不成功。还装了windows虚拟机和ubuntu server虚拟机。最后是登录了美国的appleId下载的telegram才注册成功。下午和她聊了一会天，好久都没联系了。出门散步刷视频。

Regular workday. I got up at 7:10 AM and did some core exercises. Since we had planned a dinner gathering for the evening, I didn't go biking. However, one friend couldn't make it, so the plans were canceled. At work, I did a LeetCode problem. After work, I walked home, and my takeout arrived just as I got there, so I didn't work out. Before bed, I went for a 30-minute walk.
正常上班，早晨7:10起床练了核心。由于晚上约好聚餐，所以今天没骑车，后来由于一个伙伴不能到，所以又爽约了。上班刷了一提leetcode。又在斟酌昨天的诗，又改了一次。“早昼簪曦晨，朔月散期朋”或者“早昼簪曦晨，明月散期朋”。晚上下班后没有锻炼，走路回家的，到家外卖就到了，所以没有健身了。只是睡前出去散步了30分钟。

Regular workday. I woke up at 7:10 AM and did some core exercises. In the morning, I spent time creating poetry using ChatGPT and the Xinhua Dictionary. I registered the domain zzzxc.com and came up with the phrase "早昼簪星晨" (all containing the "日" radical). I thought the best matching second line would be "朔月散青棚" (all containing the "月" character), as it maintains rhyme, tone, and a similar artistic mood. In the afternoon, I studied some Spring framework concepts and also went for a walk. In the evening, I worked out my back before dinner, watched some videos afterward, and then went for a half-hour walk.
正常上班，早晨7:10起床练了核心。上午在利用chatgpt和新华字典作诗。我注册的域名为zzzxc.com，造了一个句子“早昼簪星晨”。都带“日”部件，得出我认为最适合的下句是“朔月散青棚”都带月字。并且押韵平仄意境都还算可以。下午学了一会spring知识，也有出门出门走路。晚上回家饭前锻炼了背部。饭后刷视频，然后出门散步半小时。
