Regular workday. Today, I joined my colleagues for a smoke break in the office. In the evening, we had a team dinner, during which I ended up smoking a few cigarettes. It seems my trip to Guangdong reignited my smoking habit, so I’ll have to start quitting again. However, I think it won’t be as challenging this time—my rule is not to buy cigarettes myself. After dinner, I went out for a foot massage and then headed home to sleep.
正常上班，今天和办公室的同事去吸烟了，晚上同事聚会，一起吃了一顿饭，也吸了几只香烟，感觉广东回来后又有烟瘾了看来又要重新开始戒烟了。但是这次戒烟因该不会那么难了，我的底线就是自己不去购买香烟。回家后出门做了足浴按摩。然后回家睡觉。

I was woken up around 4 a.m. to have some dim sum. After eating, I went back to the hotel to sleep again. By noon, we went out for Cantonese food, then took a stroll down a pedestrian street. Later, we headed to a shopping center in Guangzhou, browsed around, and had dinner before going to the airport to fly back to Wenzhou. I got to the dorm at around 1 a.m. and went to sleep by 2 a.m.
睡到凌晨4点左右被叫醒去吃早茶。吃完回酒店继续睡觉了。中午去吃了粤菜，然后逛了一会步行街。出发去广州的购物中心。逛了会商超，然后吃了晚饭吃法机场飞回温州了。凌晨1点到寝室，2点钟睡了。

I couldn’t fall asleep all night, likely due to a combination of drinking, air conditioning, and an uncomfortable pillow. I finally managed to sleep around 10 a.m. After getting up, I went out with friends for dim sum, then enjoyed a foot massage in the afternoon. In the evening, we had roast goose and I tried to go to bed early. The pillow was too high, making my heart feel uncomfortable, so I couldn’t sleep until around midnight.
喝了酒的原因加空调还有枕头问题一直没睡着。上午10点才勉强睡着。起床后和朋友一起去吃早茶。然后下午去足浴了。晚上吃了烧鹅，然后早早的睡了。枕头太高了，心脏不舒服还是睡不着，晚上12点左右才睡着。

I slept in until almost noon, then went out to a farmhouse restaurant for drunken goose. In the afternoon, I strolled along a pedestrian street, had coconut tarts, and visited a dessert shop for double-skin milk pudding, buffalo milk, and fried milk—the fried milk was the best. For dinner, we had sashimi-style fish, though it wasn’t quite to my taste, and then went out for drinks, staying out until late at night.
睡到接近中午起床，然后去农家吃了醉鹅。下午逛了一会步行街，吃了椰子蛋，然后去糖水店吃了双皮奶和水牛奶，炸牛奶。炸牛奶最好吃了。晚上吃了鱼生，不太符合我的口味，然后去喝酒。一直到深夜。
