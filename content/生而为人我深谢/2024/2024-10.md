今天去杭州的华为全球培训中心参加鸿蒙系统开发的培训，上午7点起床洗漱，7:50到公司和同事一起出发的。做高铁到杭州西站打车到培训附近的酒店。放下东西直接出发了，结果报名流程有问题，不知道是哪个环节的沟通出了问题，在门口等了半个多小时还没进去大门。我们就先去吃午饭。吃完午饭后过去正好可以进入了。下午就是上课，介绍了鸿蒙系统的开发套件和开发语言。直接布置了考试任务和作业。晚上应付这个考试学了3个小时。对于我们没有接触过鸿蒙开发的人来说比较困难，然后去淘宝直接找人代考了。花了37元钱。然后玩了一会游戏就睡觉了。

After getting up, I gamed all day. In the evening, I worked out. Although I smoked six cigarettes yesterday, I had no urge to buy any today. It seems I've truly managed to control this bad habit deep in my mind.
起床后游戏了一天。晚上健身。虽然昨天吸了6支香烟，今天也没有一点想去买香烟的冲动。看来我已经彻底在脑海深处控制住了这个坏习惯了。

Here’s the translation:

"After getting up and washing up this morning, I got ready to head out by high-speed train. I grabbed some breakfast downstairs before taking a taxi to Wenzhou North Station. The new station is pretty nice and gives a bit of a Shanghai Hongqiao vibe, with separate A and B ticket gates on either side of the waiting area. When I arrived in Fuyang, my friend was supposed to pick me up, but he went to the wrong station. Fuyang has two high-speed train stations, and although he's a local, he wasn’t very familiar with the West Station where I arrived, which seems to be a new one. It was quite cold here; even though I had checked the weather and wore long sleeves, it still felt a bit chilly. He finally arrived about half an hour later. When we met, he looked like he'd put on some weight.

We went to have hot pot together and had a few drinks. We chatted for a while about life over the past few years. He seems somewhat changed, no longer as bold and confident as before. There was also a bit of unfamiliarity between us; he mentioned feeling that way, but I didn’t feel it. Perhaps my life has been too simple and uneventful, so I still remember things clearly, whereas he’s gone through major life events like marriage and having kids, which may have blurred his memories of me, making him feel more distant. We talked all afternoon. He’s preparing for the civil service exam and encouraged me to take it too, but I’m not very keen on that kind of job. He’s not the same as he was in his younger years.

At some point, I smoked the cigarettes he offered, about six throughout the afternoon. By evening, I headed back to Wenzhou since I prefer not to stay out as it affects my sleep. I was back at my dorm by 9 p.m., did some core and lower-back exercises, then steamed some eggs for a quick dinner before heading to bed."
今天上午起床洗漱后就准备坐高铁出发了，先在楼下吃了点早饭。打车去了温州北站。新的高铁站，还是比较好的。有上海虹桥站的感觉，分A和B检票口的。分别在候车站的两边。去到富阳后朋友来接我，结果接错了站。富阳有两个高铁站，他自己本地人也不太清楚我到的那个西站，应该也是新的站吧。这边很冷，我事先看了天气预报，并且穿了长袖，还是有点凉。等了半个小时他才姗姗来迟。见面之后他有点发福。然后和朋友去吃了点火锅，喝了点酒。聊了一会儿，问了这几年的生活。他和以前有些差别，没有那么意气风发了。和我之间也有点陌生，他说是有点不熟了，但是我倒是没有这个感觉。是不是我这几年经历的太少了，生活太过于简单无聊。所以和他的记忆还是比较深刻，而他经历了人生的结婚生子这些大事，将我的记忆变得模糊，从而觉得和我疏远了。聊了一个下午。他在考公务员，还劝我也考，而我是比较反感这种职业的。他也已经不像少年时的他了。中间我吸了他递过来的香烟，一下午大概吸了6支香烟吧。傍晚我就直接回温州了。我不想住外面，比较影响的我睡眠。回寝室后已经晚上9点了。锻炼了一下腰腹，蒸了点鸡蛋简单对付了一下就休息了。

A regular workday today. I went home for a nap during lunch because my workspace is too cramped to rest, especially with colleagues sitting both in front and behind me. When I got home, my dehumidifier package had arrived. I tested it, but the noise was too loud. Initially, I thought about returning it, but after learning that most dehumidifiers are noisy, I canceled the return. In the evening, I worked out and played games.
正常上班，中午回家午休的，工位前后都有同事，工位比较窄，睡不了的。回家后正好除湿机快递到了，调试了一会觉得噪音好大，本来想着退款的，后来了解到除湿机噪音都大，所以又取消了，晚上健身打游戏。

Back to a normal workday, a new colleague joined, sitting across from me—a Java developer, reportedly brought in through connections. The project map got all messed up, and the client was urgently asking for it. I ended up working overtime until 10:40 PM. My back hurt, so when I got home, I watched some videos, took a shower, and went to bed.
正常上班，工位对面来了新同事，做java开发的，听说是通过关系进来的人。项目地图错乱了，甲方又着急要，晚上加班到22:40才回家，腰痛，回家看了一会视频洗澡睡觉了。

Today was a day off. I thought about dyeing my hair again, but realized the dye had already oxidized and probably wasn’t usable anymore. I bought a cup of coffee and spent the afternoon playing games. In the evening, I tidied up the room.

Back to work today, and I spent some time learning Next.js. I found that the usage of the router is different from previous frameworks—it’s all hook-based, making it difficult to use in requests. I planned to manage the data flow with [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), which is currently a popular state management tool. However, I didn’t have enough time to explore the new framework, so I ended up using the old framework for development. On the backend, I used a newer one, but it led to CORS issues. By the end of the workday, I had a headache, likely due to forward head posture. After exercising and sweating it out at home, I felt better.Then I dyed my hair, but the color is barely noticeable. Before bed, I played PS5 and scrolled through Douyin, staying up late again and not sleeping well.
正常上班，学了一会nextjs，发现router的使用不和以前的框架一样，全都用的hooks。导致在request中不能使用。数据流准备使用[zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)。现在比较流行的状态处理工具。但是时间不够我研究使用新框架的，最后还是用老框架开发了。后台用的新的，出现的跨域问题。下班时头疼，应该是脖子前倾导致的，回家后运动出汗后就好了。然后染了头发，基本上看不出来颜色。睡前玩了ps5，又在刷抖音，晚上睡的迟，又没有睡好。

Back to work as usual, but didn’t do much—just a day of coasting. I went to bed early last night but still overslept today, so I took an hour off in the morning. In the afternoon, new development tasks came up, leaving no time to continue studying Next.js.
正常上班，没做什么事情，摸鱼的一天。昨天睡的挺早的，但是今天却睡过头了，请假了一个小时。下午有新的开发需求了，没时间再去研究nextjs了。

Back to work today. It was the first day the stock market reopened after the holiday, and at first, it went completely wild before calming down a bit. Overall, the market surged, and I nearly broke even. I ended up selling almost everything, leaving just a small portion. In this heated market, I’ve decided to sell off all my funds. I don't want to waste more time on this, whether it’s gains or losses. In the end, the only thing lost is time. Even if you make a profit, it won’t be much, and everything is relative. Those who make significant profits also face the risk of huge losses.
正常上班，假期后股市开市的第一天，刚开始彻底疯狂，慢慢降了下去，整体还是上涨很多的。我基本回本了，然后基本全卖了，还留了一点。在这次火热的市场我要讲所有基金全抛掉。以后不在这方面浪费时间，亏损盈利。到最后流失的只是时间。就算盈利也不会太多。都是相对的，能做到很多的盈利的人，也会有很大的亏损的。

The holiday ended today, and I returned to Wenzhou. There was a traffic jam along the way, which delayed my trip, so I had to reschedule my train ticket. I played games in Lishui for two hours while waiting. I got back to my dorm around 7 p.m., had dinner, and then had a two-hour voice chat with a friend. He wanted to borrow money, but it felt a bit distant and awkward, like he was overdoing the small talk because he was uncomfortable asking.
今天假期结束了，回温州，中途堵车耽误了行程，改签了动车，在丽水玩了2小时游戏。到宿舍晚上7点多。吃了晚饭和朋友语音了2小时。他的目的是为了借钱，有点见外了感觉。也许也是有些不好意思，太过于寒暄了。

I met with a friend at noon to send him off to Guangzhou. After that, I visited another friend’s place and watched some anime. In the evening, a close friend treated us to a late-night meal. There were three of us, and we talked about family, marriage, self-reflection, and vented about some of life's frustrations. Afterward, I smoked another cigarette.

In the afternoon, I went to an Apple authorized store and bought a 240W power cable for 199 yuan. I tried it at home, and it finally worked, allowing my Mac to charge properly. Afterward, I updated the system and scrolled through short videos. In the evening, I stayed home watching anime, didn't go out, then watched more short videos, showered, and went to bed.

I forgot to bring my Mac's power cable back home, so I tried a few replacement cables at home, but none could connect to my charger. I thought it might be a power issue. In the afternoon, I borrowed a cable from my childhood friend to test it, but it also didn’t work due to the power difference. In the evening, when we went out for a late-night snack, I returned the cable and we had some stir-fry together.
mac的电源线没带回去，在家里找了几条替代。插不到我的充电头上。以为是功率不对。下午问发小借了一条试了一下，线的功率不对也用不了。晚上找他吃夜宵的时候还给她了。一起吃了小炒。

Today, the temperature dropped. After having lunch at home, I went out to play mahjong with friends and then spent some time at an internet café playing games. For dinner, we had some snacks together. In the evening, I played more mahjong. I won over 100 yuan at noon, which covered the karaoke expenses from the previous night, but I lost more than 200 yuan in the evening. After a late-night snack, I went home to rest.
