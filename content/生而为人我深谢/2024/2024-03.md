Today, I stayed home and watched videos. In the evening, I went to pick up a package, but it was mistakenly delivered to Ze Xiya Yuan. The long pants I ordered arrived, but they were too large and didn't fit, so I returned them. I also exercised my back muscles. I canceled the contracts for trading in cryptocurrencies and now only deal with spot trading. Contract trading, being negative-sum and speculative, has been quite draining after a few months without much profit. So, I've decided not to engage in contract trading anymore.

Stayed at home all day and ordered takeout: tofu rice cake, milk tea, and cream puffs. I worked out, focusing mainly on my chest muscles. Bought long pants on Douyin and shorts on Taobao. Purchased a stand on Pinduoduo to record my fitness routine, spending around 1000 in total. Utilities cost me 500. The electricity meter in my room was broken and only replaced later; it recorded 90 degrees of usage over 37 days. I had originally planned to pay 200 for the electricity, but the landlord felt it was too little, so I increased it to 300. Technically, I shouldn't have had to pay this expense since the meter was out of order.

Went to work as usual and spent the day debugging ChatGPT 4, unable to send messages the entire time. Finally discovered the issue was with the node, and switching to an Australian node solved the problem. In the evening, I had dinner and went karaoke singing with colleagues. Returned home at 23:00, washed up, and went to bed. Ate instant noodles before sleeping.

After getting up, I did the laundry, cooked instant noodles and steamed eggs for breakfast. The temperature rose significantly today. I used up the remaining internet fee at the internet cafe. In the evening, around 17:30, I had dinner at a fast-food restaurant, then went home and spent 3 hours exercising while watching videos. Later, I went out to buy more instant noodles to eat.

I bought instant noodles to eat at home, but before going to bed, my stomach hurt. I'm not sure if it was because of the instant noodles or something else.

Went to work as usual and bought a ChatGPT Plus membership today, then worked overtime for half an hour in the evening. After going home, I went to the internet cafe and played games for 2 hours, then did some exercises focusing on my waist, legs, and chest. I incurred losses trading meme coins in the cryptocurrency market. The conclusion is that meme coins should not be played with.

Went to work as usual and worked overtime until 20:03 before going home. After returning, I spent some time trading in the cryptocurrency market. Today, my assets in the cryptocurrency market fluctuated significantly, going from 1800 USDT to around 1100, and then back to about 1700. It was quite a roller coaster. After that, I did some exercises focusing on my waist, legs, and arms before resting.

Yesterday, I stayed up all night watching the virtual currency market, which resulted in poor sleep. I woke up at around 9 a.m., having slept for less than five hours. After getting up, I resumed monitoring the market. I didn't earn much money, and time passed by. Later, I read a book called "Liaofan's Four Lessons". After waking up, I watched some anime and chatted with her for a while. I found out that she's getting her teeth pulled out next week.

Watched videos and checked virtual currency trading. Took another nap in the afternoon. Went to the internet cafe to play games in the evening. Haven't talked to her all week, and she hasn't reached out to me either. Realized that if I don't take action, things will remain stagnant, while time keeps moving forward. I need to drive these things forward on my own. Always move forward.

Normal work day. During the day, spent 3600 on shopping for skincare products. Yesterday, there was an offer of a gift with purchases over 2500, but it seems it ended today. Opportunities must be seized, as once missed, they may not come again.In the evening, had dinner with colleagues and then went for a massage. Unfortunately, the massage was not good, and I felt like I wasted 400 RMB. Later, we created a new group chat because one member was not fitting in and refusing to leave, causing us some distress. So, we decided to create a new one to resolve the issue.

Normal work day. Felt tired today due to lack of sleep yesterday. Had a brief chat with the new friend about the umbrella story I made up. In the evening, went home, showered, and went to bed directly. Woke up at 8:00 PM and talked to a friend on the phone about demolition matters. Couldn't sleep afterwards, so watched videos until around 2:00 AM before falling asleep again.

This afternoon, I went to the internet cafe and played games by myself for a while. I asked the current network manager for the contact information of the previous one. She said she needed to check and would only give it to me if the other party agreed. It shouldn't be difficult to obtain contact information, and if I couldn't get it, it wouldn't be a big deal either. I found out that she had started school again and was working during the winter break. She is a college student.In the evening, I went to the hair salon and got my hair permed. It turned out okay, but I've decided not to perm it again in the future. I believe that a good hairstyle comes from proper grooming, not just from perming.
