Went to work as usual. In the afternoon, the leader called me and another colleague into the office to say that we might need to be stationed at the Traffic Management Bureau on Chezhan Avenue. There might be some subsidies provided to us, and other details would be discussed once we get there.

Went to work as usual. I didn't sleep well last night, so I felt groggy and uncomfortable, especially my heart, which always feels uneasy after a poor night's sleep. Couldn't nap at lunch because a colleague was snoring. In the evening, I played on my phone for a while after getting home, then washed up and went to bed.

I spent some time resting and watching videos. Went out for a stroll. In the evening, I played Werewolf and worked out my chest muscles.

I worked out my back muscles at home, went out for a haircut in the evening, and it rained. I went for a massage to relax my muscles. After that, on my way home, I fell off my bike, landing directly on my backside; the sidewalk was too slippery, and I shouldn't have ridden on it. I went home, took a shower, and rested.

Today marks the start of the three-day Qingming Festival holiday. I'm spending it at home exercising my chest muscles and watching videos.

Went to work as usual. In the morning, after getting up and freshening up, I opened the window and walked over to the coffee table to drink some milk. I noticed the clothes rack shaking and initially thought it was just the wind from the window causing it, but then I suddenly felt a bit dizzy. My body was shaking too, and I wondered why I was feeling dizzy as if I had just smoked, even though I hadn't. I thought something was wrong with my health, but then I realized it was an earthquake. I thought about rushing downstairs immediately and quickly put on my shoes. I didn't run down; instead, I even took my headphones and room keys, and even considered grabbing some decorations. Maybe it was my subconscious thinking that earthquakes here in Wenzhou are usually just aftershocks and fundamentally not dangerous. Or maybe my judgment was really off, worrying about my appearance even in a dangerous situation. By the time I was actually ready to go downstairs, the shaking had already stopped. Today, I was fixing bugs. My subordinate couldn't even pinpoint the problems in the bugs he created, let alone solve them. Sigh, it feels a bit frustrating.

Went to work as usual, and today was the day to submit our development work for testing, since we needed to present it to the users after the Qingming Festival. I had completed my own tasks, but the work assigned to my subordinate was not properly done. The level of negligence was quite exaggerated. By the day of submission, some requirements hadn't even been fully understood. He was unable to complete even slightly challenging tasks independently. I ended up cleaning up all the messes. After work, he stayed late as a consequence of his own inadequate performance. After coming home, I exercised my chest muscles.
