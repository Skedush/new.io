睡了好久。可能那褪黑素真的有用吧。晚上约了朋友一起吃饭，中午看了一会动漫，洗完衣服又去网吧玩英雄联盟了。垃圾游戏，选不到我想要的英雄。晚上吃饭和朋友聊了一会关于加密货币与生活上面的事情。关于欲望与金钱

上午体检，不知道为什么，抽完血之后感觉好累，很想睡觉，非常疲惫。下午回家后躺在床上又感觉身子非常虚浮。睡不着。休息一会后去牙科医院洗牙。晚上回家后吃了两颗类似褪黑素功效的保健品睡觉了。

Went to work as usual and brought a U-shaped pillow, which made my nap much more comfortable. In the evening, I went home to study and practice posture correction.

After waking up, I cooked some corn for breakfast and waited for my clothes to finish washing before heading to the internet cafe to play "League of Legends." I wanted to play as Ryze, a champion that I hadn't seen in the game for the last two days. It's ridiculous; nearly 30 matches of 5-person random, with each person averaging two random selections, which should cycle through about 300 champions. Considering there are only about 160 champions in total, the odds were just too frustrating. I've decided not to play anymore, which might be a turning point for me. After coming home in the evening, I exercised.

I got up to go for a medical check-up, and though I remembered I needed to hold my urine when I first woke up, I forgot by the time I reached the bathroom and ended up going. After that, I realized that spending over 2000 at the hospital wouldn't be worth it if the results were inaccurate due to not holding my urine. So, I canceled the appointment and went back home. After having breakfast at home, I watched "Death Note" and fell asleep again. I woke up around noon, and a friend invited me to play "League of Legends" at an internet cafe. In the evening, I went home to exercise and continued watching the "Death Note" anime.

Went to work as usual, and in the evening, I watched anime at home and worked out my back and core muscles. I accidentally twisted my waist while stretching, though it was a minor injury. I need to be more careful in the future and not push my stretching to the limit.

Went to work as usual. In the afternoon, the leader called me and another colleague into the office to say that we might need to be stationed at the Traffic Management Bureau on Chezhan Avenue. There might be some subsidies provided to us, and other details would be discussed once we get there.

Went to work as usual. I didn't sleep well last night, so I felt groggy and uncomfortable, especially my heart, which always feels uneasy after a poor night's sleep. Couldn't nap at lunch because a colleague was snoring. In the evening, I played on my phone for a while after getting home, then washed up and went to bed.

I worked out my back muscles at home, went out for a haircut in the evening, and it rained. I went for a massage to relax my muscles. After that, on my way home, I fell off my bike, landing directly on my backside; the sidewalk was too slippery, and I shouldn't have ridden on it. I went home, took a shower, and rested.

Went to work as usual. In the morning, after getting up and freshening up, I opened the window and walked over to the coffee table to drink some milk. I noticed the clothes rack shaking and initially thought it was just the wind from the window causing it, but then I suddenly felt a bit dizzy. My body was shaking too, and I wondered why I was feeling dizzy as if I had just smoked, even though I hadn't. I thought something was wrong with my health, but then I realized it was an earthquake. I thought about rushing downstairs immediately and quickly put on my shoes. I didn't run down; instead, I even took my headphones and room keys, and even considered grabbing some decorations. Maybe it was my subconscious thinking that earthquakes here in Wenzhou are usually just aftershocks and fundamentally not dangerous. Or maybe my judgment was really off, worrying about my appearance even in a dangerous situation. By the time I was actually ready to go downstairs, the shaking had already stopped. Today, I was fixing bugs. My subordinate couldn't even pinpoint the problems in the bugs he created, let alone solve them. Sigh, it feels a bit frustrating.

Went to work as usual, and today was the day to submit our development work for testing, since we needed to present it to the users after the Qingming Festival. I had completed my own tasks, but the work assigned to my subordinate was not properly done. The level of negligence was quite exaggerated. By the day of submission, some requirements hadn't even been fully understood. He was unable to complete even slightly challenging tasks independently. I ended up cleaning up all the messes. After work, he stayed late as a consequence of his own inadequate performance. After coming home, I exercised my chest muscles.
