I woke up today and started by watching anime. Then, I packed my luggage and after having lunch, I booked a moving service through Meituan. I continued organizing my things and set off at 2 o'clock. The traffic was heavy; it took me 30 minutes to cover a 2-kilometer distance. The movers carried my belongings to the 5th floor, and the service cost a total of 165 RMB. There was no hot water in the room, so I went back to my previous rental place to freshen up. After turning on the water heater, I went to an internet café to play games. When the water was heated, I returned to take a shower and then carried the last bit of my belongings to the new place. I spent the whole night cleaning. When I went to bed, I noticed the loud train noises outside the window. I hadn't paid attention to this during the house viewing. In the quiet night, the noise was exceptionally loud, as if a train was passing right by my bed. Perhaps it's due to the new place or maybe I was too warm with too many clothes on while sleeping, but I couldn't fall asleep all night.
