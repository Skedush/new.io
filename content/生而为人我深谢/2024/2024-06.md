I worked as usual today, but I felt down and spent most of the time on trivial, meaningless tasks unrelated to work. In the evening, I watched videos and browsed on Taobao.

Today, it rained heavily all day. I stayed at home watching videos, constantly thinking about doing something productive but ended up just watching videos. At night, I couldn't sleep again. There was some noise from the neighbors playing games, but my sleeplessness was mainly due to my own mental state rather than the noise, which was only a minor disturbance.

Before going to bed, I was browsing Taobao, wasting time trying to save a few bucks. In the future, I should just buy what I like or need without worrying about discounts or promotions. This behavior wastes a lot of time and energy. It's better to use that time for something more productive, like going to bed early, which is far more valuable than saving a small amount of money.

I had a regular day at work. In the evening, I watched videos and browsed Taobao at home.Today, I reapplied for the deletion of my League of Legends account. I am determined not to play for two weeks. Although the account is worth some money, the presence of cheats in competitive games is really frustrating.

At noon, I went out to play games with a good friend. In the evening, I had a family dinner at a hotel and drank half a bottle of wine. Later, an old friend invited me and another childhood friend to have a late-night snack. I spent the evening at his flower shop, drinking a few cups of milk tea. Around 9:30 PM, we had some barbecue and I didn't get home until midnight.

After waking up, I packed my things and took a bus back home. My ID card is about to expire, so I took the day off to renew it and also handled some banking matters. After dinner, I was very tired and took a one-hour nap. Later, I went out for a late-night snack with an old friend.

Today, I had an appointment with the doctor, but it was raining heavily. After waking up, I cooked some corn and took the bus to the hospital. I first visited the orthopedics department for a follow-up on the spinal bifida issue found during my last check-up. The doctor said it was nothing serious and not the cause of my back pain, which is due to muscle and ligament problems. He prescribed some medicated patches for me to use. Then I visited the respiratory department for my recent coughing problem. I had booked an appointment with a specialist, and the consultation fee was 150 yuan. However, my cough had already improved significantly. After I described my symptoms to the specialist, he didn't say a word and just prescribed some medicine, then I paid and left. After returning home, I spent the evening watching videos and TV shows.
