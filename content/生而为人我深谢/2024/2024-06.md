At noon, I went out to play games with a good friend. In the evening, I had a family dinner at a hotel and drank half a bottle of wine. Later, an old friend invited me and another childhood friend to have a late-night snack. I spent the evening at his flower shop, drinking a few cups of milk tea. Around 9:30 PM, we had some barbecue and I didn't get home until midnight.

Today, I had an appointment with the doctor, but it was raining heavily. After waking up, I cooked some corn and took the bus to the hospital. I first visited the orthopedics department for a follow-up on the spinal bifida issue found during my last check-up. The doctor said it was nothing serious and not the cause of my back pain, which is due to muscle and ligament problems. He prescribed some medicated patches for me to use. Then I visited the respiratory department for my recent coughing problem. I had booked an appointment with a specialist, and the consultation fee was 150 yuan. However, my cough had already improved significantly. After I described my symptoms to the specialist, he didn't say a word and just prescribed some medicine, then I paid and left. After returning home, I spent the evening watching videos and TV shows.
